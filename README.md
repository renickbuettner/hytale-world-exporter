### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renickbuettner/hytale-world-exporter.git
cd hytale-world-exporter
cargo build --release
```

#### macOS: Open app by bypassing Gatekeeper

Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet, macOS Gatekeeper may block it. To open the app:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run the following command, replacing the path with your app's path. You can drag-and-drop the app into the Terminal to get the correct path.
3. ```bash
   xattr -cr "/path/to/Hytale World Exporter.app"
   ```
4. Now try opening the app again.

When building locally on macOS, you can sign the app bundle with an ad-hoc signature:

```bash
# Build the binary
cargo build --release

# Create app bundle
mkdir -p "Hytale World Exporter.app/Contents/MacOS"
mkdir -p "Hytale World Exporter.app/Contents/Resources"
cp target/release/hytale-world-exporter "Hytale World Exporter.app/Contents/MacOS/"

# Create Info.plist (see build workflow for full example)
# ...

# Sign with ad-hoc signature
codesign --force --deep --sign - "Hytale World Exporter.app"
```

## World Paths

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Hytale/UserData/Saves`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Hytale/UserData/Saves`
